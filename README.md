# Two AI Connect Four
This was the final project of codecademy's "Learn the Basics of Machine Learning" course. The goal was to create an algorithm that could beat codecademy's AI in a game of connect four.

When the program is ran, it prints an updated version of the board after each turn.

This project was developed using the following technoligies:

- Python 3
- Deepcopy

To run this program on your local machine after installing the files, run "python3 script.py in the terminal.

Here is a preview of the two bots competing with each other.
